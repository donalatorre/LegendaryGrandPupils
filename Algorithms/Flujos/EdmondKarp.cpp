/*
Edmonds-Karp algorithm O(VE^2)
Max flow
The matrix capacity stores the capacity for every pair of vertices. 
adj is the adjacency list of the undirected graph, 
since we have also to use the reversed of directed edges when we are looking for augmenting paths.

The function maxflow will return the value of the maximal flow. 
During the algorithm the matrix capacity will actually store the residual capacity of the network. 
The value of the flow in each edge will actually no stored, 
but it is easy to extent the implementation - by using an additional matrix - to also store the flow and return it.
